# Process - Part 8 - Start the Java Apps

## 8.1 Start your consumer using the command provided. What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans: 
- You can start Kafka consumer using the below command from C:\44517\kafka_2.12-2.4.1:
#### .\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bearcat-messages --from-beginning
- If there is any existing project: Open PowerShell here as Administrator in the root project folder, start the original consumer app using topic test and group1 using the below command:
#### java -cp target/kafka-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Consumer test group1
- For Starting Custom producer Open PowerShell as Administrator in the root project folder, start the original consumer app: 
#### java -cp target/kafka-case-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.nwmissouri.isl.bhagyasree2895.kafka.CustomConsumer
We need to run these commands from the above specified directories because When a consumer group is active, you can inspect partition assignments, groups and consumption progress from the command line using the consumer-groups.sh script, which is located in the bin directory of the Kafka distribution.

## 8.2 What topic is the consumer listening to? Where is this specicified?

Ans:
The consumer listening to "test".
It is specified after the topic and the command is below
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning


## 8.3 What group is this consumer in? Where is this specicified?

Ans: In this the group of the consumer is group1 and it is specified after the topic name test


## 8.4 Start one of the producer apps using the command provided. What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans: To start one of the producer apps it is recommended to be inside root directory of the application.  After compiling our project Maven creates the .jar file in target folder after giving goal as package or install or deploy. To run the application we have to run the .jar file. Other way is we change the directory from root to target and directly we can run the .jar file from target folder by invoking the by starting a Java runtime environment i.e giving java cammand and jar file as argument.  To run this jar file either we can go to the root folder give the path of the jar file along with the class having main() method as argument to java -cp command.


## 8.5 What topic is the producer writing to? Where is this specicified?

Ans: The producer is writing to "test-message" which then the same will be listened in the consumer.
below command is used to specify the writing of the message.
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-message


## 8.6 If you wanted to change the topic name, what do you have to do? 

Ans: Renaming a topic is not a supported operation. However, the latest Kafka versions now support topic deletion. So you can simply delete the old topic, and create a new one with the new name.


## 8.7 Look at Consumer.java - what is it doing? Hint - what classes is it using? What methods are being called?

Ans: Generally in kafka each  topic is divided into logs known as partitions. producers writes to them and consumers read them at their owm place . 
-Here in the Consumer.java the methods figure out where to start the messages from by the partitions to the particular consumers and they start processing the messages and closes them whenever it gets closed.


## 8.8 Look at Producer.java - what is it doing? Explore the code.

Ans: I had explored the producer code present in simple folder in kafka-api provided to us. According to this code i had understood that after configuring the properties in producer file it is reading in the lines that are entered on the console and sending those to the consumer and these lines are nothing but the messages tranferred from producer to consumer.

Review: Yes, Its absolutly right the below pease of code explains the scenario 
	String line = in.nextLine();
	this line reads from console through an scanner object
        while(!line.equals("exit")) {
	this line reads text from console untill it finds the text exit from console
            ProducerRecord<String, String> rec = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(topicName,line);
	    this line creates an producer object for class ProducerRecord expects two strings usually theya re topc and input line
            producer.send(rec);
	    this line sends data to the consumer
            line = in.nextLine();
        }


## 8.9 Look at ProducerHello.java - what is it doing? How is it different from Producer?

Ans:Producer will send messages to kafka broker.ProducerHello.java we ned to give a topic name and a message. If message is hello then topic name and message will be displayed 10 times, and it will be displayed in until line is not equal to exit.In Producer.java we dont have the message block but the topic name will be printed until line is not equals to exit.


## 8.10 Look at ProducerSentence.java - what is it doing? How is it different from ProducerHello?
 
Ans: In ProducerSentence.java we need to give a topic name and create a sentence and store in message, and it will be printed till 10 times. and it will print topic name and line wll be printed until the line is equal to exit. 

Below logic is difference between ProducerSentence and ProducerHello:
ProducerSentence:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
String message = createSentence();
ProducerRecord<String, String> rec = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(topicName, message);
producer.send(rec);
}
```
ProducerHello:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
      String message = "hello" + i;
      ProducerRecord<String, String> rec = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(topicName, message);
      producer.send(rec);
    }
```

## 8.11 Look at ProducerSentenceRandom.java - what is it doing? How is it different from the others?

Ans: The ProducerSentenceRandom is creating a random sentence by calling the private method create sentence by assigning the random numbers to the array and returning the random sentence from the stored string objects. It is different from others, as ProducerHello just returns the message hello and the ProducerSentence prints the sentence and whereas ProducerSentenceRandom prints the random sentences from defined set of strings. 


## 8.12 If you were asked to make a new custom producer, how would you start? 

Ans:

- A producer is is a program that produces information. In some scenarios it can collect information and puts messages into Kafka topics. 

- First of all I will download the kafka software binaries, buildtool (Maven) and do necessary changes in environment variable settings.

- Maven work over the principle of convention over configuration hence I will create a standard maven project using any IDE. 

- In src/main/java folder I will create a new package (e.g com.prajaktconsulting.assignmentpart2) and create a custom producer class in the package. 

- If we want to extract some data from any other third party application like twitter then we have to mention the credentials of that to our producer.

- There are two ways to give the information about how to access the third party app to our producer

	1. Either we can directly write the credentials information in our producer class but this is not good coding practive because this makes our class tightly coupled with the third party application credentials. Tightly coupling means if in future third party application credentials got changed then we have to go to the producer class again and change those credentials. After making changes we again have to compile and run the application. This is hectic process. Hence we did not follow this process we followed the below process
	
	2. We created the properties file and gave the credentials of Twitter account in properties file because of this our producer class and the Twitter account information is lossely coupled. In future if the credentials changed also we can directly go to properties file and change the information.
	
- After this According to our requirement I will code for the custom producer class and will refer the properties files ceredentials in Producer class.
